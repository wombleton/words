A
Well, I left Kentucky back in '49
 	    D
An' 	went to Detroit workin' on a 'sembly line
 	    E                                               A
The     first year they had me puttin' wheels on cadil  lacs

Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
 	    D
And     sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
 	        E                                        A
'Cause I    always wanted me one that was long and 	 black.

One day I devised myself a plan
        D
That    should be the envy of most any man
        E                                           A
I'd     sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my   hand

Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
        D
But     I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
        E                                       A
I'd     have me a car worth at least a hundred  grand.

CHORUS

I'd get it one piece at a time
 	    D
And it  wouldn't cost me a dime
 	    E                                   	A
You'll  know it's me when I come through your   town

I'm gonna ride around in style
 	        D
I'm gonna   drive ever'body wild
 	            E	                            A
'Cause I'll     have the only one there is a-   round.

So the very next day when I punched in
        D
With    my big lunchbox and with help from my friends
    E                                       A
I   left that day with a lunch box full of  gears

Now I never considered myself a thief
        D
But     GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
    E                                           A
Es  pecially if I strung it out over several    years.

The first day I got me a fuel pump
        D
And     the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
        E                                       A
Then    I got me a transmission and all of the  chrome

The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
        D
Like    nuts, an' bolts, and all four shocks
        E                                                   A
But     the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile     home.

Now up to now my plan went allright
        D
'Til    we tried to put it all together one night
        E                                                       A
And     that's when we noticed that something was definitely    wrong.

The transmission was a '53
        D
And     the motor turned out to be a '73

        E                                                       A
And     when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were    gone.

So we drilled it out so that it would fit
        D
And     with a little bit of help with an A-daptor kit
    E                                       A
We  had that engine runnin' just like a     song

Now the headlight' was another sight
    D
We  had two on the left and one on the right
        E                                                       A
But     when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come     on.

The back end looked kinda funny too
        D
But     we put it together and when we got thru
        E                                                   A
Well,   that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-   fin

About that time my wife walked out
        D
And     I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
        E                                                   A
But     she opened the door and said "Honey, take me for a  spin."

So we drove up town just to get the tags
        D
And I   headed her right on down main drag
    E                                           A
I   could hear ever'body laughin' for blocks    around

But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
        D
'Cause  to type it up it took the whole staff
        E                                               A
And     when they got through the title weighed sixty   pounds.

I'd get it one piece at a time
 	    D
And it  wouldn't cost me a dime
 	    E                                   	A
You'll  know it's me when I come through your   town

I'm gonna ride around in style
 	        D
I'm gonna   drive ever'body wild
 	            E	                            A
'Cause I'll     have the only one there is a-   round.
