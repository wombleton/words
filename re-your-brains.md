 Heya Tom, it's Bob From the office down the hall
Em               C                 D
 Good to see you buddy, how've you been?
C              Em                Em7                  A7 
 Things have been OK for me except that I'm a zombie now
                           D
I really wish you'd let us in
  C                 G                B7         Em
I think I speak for all of us when I say I understand
  C                 G                B7         Em
Why you folks might hesitate to submit to our demands
    C              Cm
But here's an FYI: you're all gonna die screaming

G     D             C               D
All we want to do is eat your brains
            G                   D                       C
We're not unreasonable, I mean, no-one's gonna eat your eyes
G     D             C               D
All we want to do is eat your brains
            Em            Bm           C  
We're at an impasse here, maybe we should compromise:
       C             Am
If you open up the doors
C                         D        G
We'll all come inside and eat your brains

Em                C               G                 Gmaj7
I don't want to nitpick, Tom, but is this really your plan?
Em                   C                    D    
To spend your whole life locked inside a mall?
C                   Em                     Em7                  A7
Maybe that's OK for now but someday you'll be out of food and guns
                                D
And then you'll have to make the call
C                  G                B7           Em
I'm not surprised to see you haven't thought it through enough
C                  G                 B7           Em
You never had the head for all that bigger picture stuff
C                               Cm
But Tom, that's what I do, and I plan on eating you slowly

G     D             C               D

We'll all come inside and eat your brains
                             G#dim          G#
I'd like to help you Tom, in any   way   I can
         G#m                             D#
I sure appreciate the way you're working with me
          A#                  G#dim        Cm
I'm not a monster Tom, well, technically I am
          G
I guess I am

Em              C              G               G    Gmaj7
I've got another meeting Tom, maybe we could wrap it up
Em               C                 D
I know we'll get to common ground somehow
    C               Em                Em7                           A7
Meanwhile I'll report back to my colleagues who were chewing on the doors
                           D
I guess we'll table this for now
  C                 G                B7         Em
I'm glad to see you take constructive criticism well
  C                 G                B7         Em
Thank you for your time I know we're all busy as hell
    C                           Cm
And we'll put this thing to bed when I bash your head open


G     D             C               D
