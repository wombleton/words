I remember when our chorus was a host
But now most of the voices are a ghost
I'm not angry, I'm still free
When I leap out of the sea
Most of the family are ghosts

The land might be crowded but out here I'm fine
The land might be crowded but the empty sea is mine
I know all the others
Just my cousins and my brothers
Most of the family are ghosts

It's okay, I understand, we all have to eat
And honestly stuff 'em, fish are just meat
But you I know I miss the song
It's a mercy I won't live long
I'm going to join the family as a ghost

I will never meet you, it's the way it has to be
I'm just glad to know you'll guard my memory
That when I go to sleep
And I fall into the deep
You'll sing Hector's, Hector's, Hector's
Hector's, Hector's, Hector's
Hector's, Hector's, Hector's to me
