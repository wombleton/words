I remember when our chorus was a host
But now most of the voices are a ghost
I'm not angry, I'm still free
When I leap, yeah, that's me
Most of the chorus is a ghost

The land might be crowded but out here I'm fine
The land might be crowded but the empty sea is mine
I know all the others
My cousins and my brothers
Most of the chorus is a ghost

It's okay, I understand, we all have to eat
And honestly fuck 'em, fish are just meat
But you I know I miss the song
It's a mercy I won't live long
I'm going to join the chorus as a ghost

I will never meet you, it's the way it has to be
I'm just glad to know you'll guard my memory
That when I go to sleep
And I fall into the deep
You'll sing Hector's, Hector's, Hector's
Hector's, Hector's, Hector's
Hector's, Hector's, Hector's to me
