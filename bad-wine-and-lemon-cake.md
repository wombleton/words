         G            Bm       
I have a little house
Em       D               G        Bm    Em
Close to town but not to the city
         D                 G      Bm    Em
Far from home but near my family
         D                  G      Bm    
No water views but so close to the sea
  Em            D            G          Bm     Em  D
I see, this is how my little life could be
                G             Bm     Em
And I'm filling it with things
          D           G        Bm      Em
Like furniture I find on the street
             D                 G        Bm    Em
And all the special things I'd like to eat
            D               G       Bm          Em      
Pictures of people that I'd like to meet, I'll meet them
           D           *Em
While I'm orbiting the world
             *D             *Em     D 
And it's so pretty and so lonely
           G      Bm  Em         D                  G   Bm      Em
My lovely love affairs are all scheduled 'round the TV guide
           D                  G     Bm      Em
And my sex life has all been plagiarized
       D                 G        Bm    Em   D
In an attempt to meet a harsh deadline
            G          Bm   Em
I'd like to rent a wife
             D               G          Bm  Em
Then rent a husband to keep her for life
             D               G       Bm
The three of us, we could be so happy
Em              D               G   Bm
Them with each other, me with company
      Em               D                  *Em
I'll see them off on a flight around the world
            *D             *Em   D
And it's so pretty and so lonely
             Em                D
I could just die, I might just die
             Em                D
I could just die, I might just die
          G      Bm    Em
And at my funeral
               D              G        Bm   Em
They will say Tom he was such a nice guy
             D            G        Bm       Em
He went too early but he went in style
                 D              G        Bm     Em  
They'll play my music and then they will cry
D                    G         Bm      Em
Then they'll have a little wake
                  D                     G        Bm    Em
They'll drink bad wine and they'll eat lemon cake
        D               G          Bm     Em  
And my mother's little heart will break
                D                       G         Bm 
And she'll say "Wait there must be must some mistake.
    Em        D       G      Bm      Em
He can't be dead, take me instead"
D               Em
Oh, but I'm not dead
                      D
They tell me I'm not dead
                          Em
And they say that I'm not dead
                 D
And that I won't die for some time
      G           Bm  Em
In my little house
              D              G          Bm    Em
Just writing little songs to pass the time
           D                G          Bm    Em
Which incidentally is seven forty nine
              D          G          Bm      Em
So don't you worry I'm completely fine, I'm fine
             D           G          Bm       Em
And don't you worry I'm completely fine, I'm fine
           D          G          Bm       Em
Don't you worry I'm completely fine, I'm fine
          D          G           Bm       Em
Don't you worry I'm completely fine, I'm fine
            D        G          Bm         Em
Don't you worry I'm completely fine, I'm fine
    D               G
I'm just so fucking fine.
