every five years I climb my hill
never knowing what I will see
every five years I look over the land
to see what tales it tells me

it's a fair old climb from down in the dale
and the view up there is quite fine
and wonder and the glory of acheiving the summit
is that every I see is mine

well it should be amazing, it should be fantastic
my spirits surely should rise
but every five years I climb this damn hill
and look out with tears in my eyes

I don't like myself at the bottom of the valley
I don't like myself down in the dale
I sit on the hill, and promise up a storm
Knowing I'll walk down and fail

I've tried every way, I've tried every path
I've tried camping out over night
But in the end I'm trudging down that hill
Knowing that for five more years I've lost the fight

Every five years I climb my hill
And I know what I will see
I'll look out o'er the land
and ink graphs and tears will chastise me

Well my legs are weary
My head is sore
My heart and bones
Can't take it no more

I'm staying in the valley
No more climbin' for me
I'm staying down at home
No more will I see

I don't care to know, I don't care look 
And I'll tell my son the same:
Don't climb that hill, it'll end in tears
Just stay down here in shame
