down in new orleans on julia street
there's a lawyer man you don't want to meet

he says trust me trust me it'll be alright
sign in blood on a full moon night

'fore you die, 'fore you die
drink a little poison 'fore you die

lawyer lawyer who are you
hangman's noose is looking good on you

waste our time with your nickel and dime
taste a drink of this home made wine

'fore you die, 'fore you die
drink a little poison 'fore you die

liar liar with your pants on fire
I'll be dancing 'round your funeral pyre

'fore you die, 'fore you die
drink a little poison 'fore you die

now all you ever maybe cry
keep on down but you don't know why
