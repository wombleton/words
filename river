Wheels spinning in the dark
But the rider has gone on
The rider has gone on
The rider has gone on into the dark

When the ash slips into the water
The fish come to see who is new
When the ash slips into the water
It's only you, only you, only you

See a hill and know it's not the one
But it has an echo
The hill it has an echo
An echo of the rider in the dark

When the ash slips into the water
The fish come to see who is new
When the ash slips into the water
It's only you, only you, only you

Ashes strewn upon a river
The water's just a dream
And the people mourn in masks
But they'll watch over our rider in the dark

When the ash slips into the water
The fish come to see who is new
When the ash slips into the water
It's only you, only you, only you
