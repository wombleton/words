Now I 	taught the weeping willow how 	to 	cry,
 	                            G7	        A7	        D7
and I showed the clouds how to 	cover up a 	clear blue 	sky.
 	        G	                            G7              	C7
And the 	tears that I cried for that 	woman are gonna 	flood you Big River.
 	    G	                    D7	                G	    D7	G
Then 	I'm gonna sit right 	here 	un	til I 	die.

I met   her accidentally in St.     Paul (Minnesota).
 	                            G7	            A7	                D7
And it tore me up ev'ry time    I heard her     drawl, Southern     drawl.
 	    G	                G7               C7
Then I  heard my dream was  back downstream  cavortin' in Davenport,
 	    G	                D7	        G	            D7	G
And     I followed you,     Big River,  when you called.

 	        G	                       C	                G
Then you    took me to St. Louis later on (down the river).
 	                   G7	            :wq:::wq::wq        A7	                D7
A freighter said she's been here    but she's   gone, boy, she's    gone.
 	        G	                            G7              	C7
I found     her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block.
 	    G	                    D7	                G	    D7	G
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone.

 	    G	                            C	    G
Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on.
 	                            G7	        A7	        D7
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans.
 	        G	                            G7              	C7
Go on, I"ve had enough; dump my blues down in the gulf.
 	    G	                    D7	                G	    D7	G
She loves you, Big River, more than me.

 	    G	                            C	    G
Now I 	taught the weeping willow how 	to 	cry,
