Ruru
====

    every five years I climb my hill
    every five years the same
    I climb that hill, I climb that hill
    to survey my domain

    I climb that ridge, I climb that hill
    the way is hard and long
    I climb that hill with tears in my eyes
    to the ruru's mournful song

    down in the valley the water is blue
    the air is sweet and clear
    noone lacks for food or drink
    and the law is just and fair

    everyone has a voice
    and their limbs are straight and true
    were I a smart man I'd stay in the valley
    but hell, what can I do

    every five years I climb my hill
    every five years the same
    I climb that hill, I climb that hill
    to survey my domain

    I climb that ridge, I climb that hill
    the way is hard and long
    I climb that hill with tears in my eyes
    to the ruru's mournful song

    'cause just above the treeline
    the scales fall from my eyes
    every five years up on that hill
    the valley's dream it dies

    my legs are tired and weary
    my breath is ragged and spent
    I like my dream, I'll hold it close
    And love it hundred percent

    So I'm staying down in the valley
    and bidding my hill so long
    forget I every climbed it
    to the ruru's mournful song
