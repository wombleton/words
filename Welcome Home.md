(Verse 1)
Em  D/F#     G
Tonight I am feeling for you 
Amin      G/B        D
Under the state of a strange land 
Em       D/F#       G
You have sacrificed much to be here 
Amin          G/B          D
There but for graceâ€¦' as I offer my hand 

(Chorus)  
C   G        D                 C
Welcome home I bid you welcome I bid you welcome 
C   G        D        C
Welcome home from the bottom of my heart 

G        C           G         C
G        C           G         C

(Verse 2)
Em  D/F# G
And out  here on the edge 
Amin          G/B        D
The empire is fading by the day 
Em      D/F#        G
And the world is so weary in war 
Amin        G/B           D
Maybe we'll find that new way 

(Chorus)
C       G        D              C
So welcome home, see I made a space for you now 
C   G        D        C
Welcome home from the bottom of our heart 
C   G        D        C
Welcome home from the bottom of our hearts 

G        C           G         C
G        C           G         C

(Bridge)
Em                         G
Keep it coming now keep it coming now 
Em                               G
You'll find most of us here with hearts wide open 
Em                         G
Keep it coming now keep on coming now 
        B7                 
Keep it coming now keep on  

Em     D/F#   G   Am   G/B   C   D
coming now........................




(Verse 3)
Em         D/F#          G
There's a woman with her hands trembling 
Amin    G/B    D
hae.....re.....mai 
Em       D/F#        G             
And she sings with a mountain's memory 
Amin    G/B    D
hae.....re.....mai 
Em         D/F#          G            
There's a cloud the full length of these isles 
Amin         G/B            D
Just playing chase with the sun 
Em         D/F#          G  
And it's black and it's white and it's wild 
Amin    G/B         D
All the colours are one 

(Chorus)
C     G         D                 C
So welcome home I bid you welcome I bid you 
C       G        D              C
Welcome home see I made a space for you now 
C       G        D    C
Welcome home from the bottom of our hearts 
                       G
From the bottom of our hearts
